The LoleSports website would be very nice to watch games i have missed, however it is impossible to enjoy these games, since the results are always on the link itself. If you know what team will win, the matches are actually pretty boring to watch. I remember at the last Worlds you were only able to see the results if you clicked on a specified button. I was wondering why this function wasn't added for the regular splits, and if its possible to put it in again.","replies":[]}
