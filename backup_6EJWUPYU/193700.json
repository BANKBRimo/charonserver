Me as a the Vlad-Player could clearly see the animation of the Pool but right after that Jump lands the Pool disappears and Vladimir is in his &quot;normal Form&quot;. Sadly the Pool has Cooldown after that Bug so you cant reuse that ability. \r\n\r\nIt appeared in these Steps:\r\n-Fizz uses his e and is hovering in the air.\r\n-Vladimir is using his w and therefore goes into the pool\r\n-at the same time Fizz Jumps onto Vladimir with his e\r\n-Vladimir stops going into the pool and can be harmed by fizz.\r\n\r\nI hope I described well enough to understand. Sadly I have no footage of that bug, because I did not record that game.","replies":[]}
