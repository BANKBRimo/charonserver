One of them is a former high ranked SC2 player who goes under the summoner name &quot;MVP Bonjwa&quot;. The summoners of the other korean players i have to still figure out. Currently they are still leveling up to 30 so you may end up in a game with them  I am personally hoping that they will start to stream in twitch. I always enjoy watching skilled players play league.\n\nEDIT: Ok one of the other koren Player who migrated to EUW goes under the summoner name of \"KR Lion\"\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"Cpt Booty Hook","date":"2015-11-13T13:26:41.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well If he is good i just hope that i get matched with him in ranked games XD","replies":[]}]}
