It looked like as if they didn&#039;t even skill their ultimate.\r\nI uploaded the moment when it happened to youtube to show further evidence of this bug.\r\n\r\nAs you can see i press Tab, then Escape and then the ultimate timers of every champion is gone except maokais.\r\nThis led to alot of confusion ingame and a strong fight because of this missunderstanding/bug.","replies":[]}
