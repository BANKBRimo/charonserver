And I see Quinn&#039;s portrait colored in (and I know that she&#039;s not on free week), but I don&#039;t have her, so I&#039;m like &quot;um..?&quot; And then when I glance around, I realize I don&#039;t have Renekton or Rumble either. But I DO own the names they&#039;re listed above (Brand, Ezreal, and Caitlyn). The thing with Orianna/Gnar is that I own both of them, so obviously the problem isn&#039;t exclusive to champions I don&#039;t own. I just noticed this today, and all the champions past these when I scrolled down were correct, and Orianna was listed above her name. So, basically, her portrait is there twice. After I refreshed the champions tab, it was all back to normal, but still thought it was worth reporting.","replies":[]}
