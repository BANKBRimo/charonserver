The team is slightly new (~2 months) but concidering that, the \r\nsynergy is looking realy good. We&#039;ve had a coach already, who unfortunatly couldn&#039;t continue.\r\n\r\nFor now the coach spot is still free, despide a person already wanting it. We basicly still want to see if there&#039;s a better option.\r\n\r\nThe team itself is going to participate at Tournaments and at a grand League from January onwards.\r\n\r\nThere are no real requirements for now, just saying - The last Support has been an ex Master Coach and been D2 himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if your interessted in coaching a team to a fiew pricepool-oriented Tourneys, go ahead and give me an add:    2N Phili","replies":[]}
