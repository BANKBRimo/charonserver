Screan freezes for a sec. Maybe it is not a serious thing, but still annoying. Other players had this problem as well.\r\nAnd today our ping is high. My friend dcs almost every game when the login screen is up. He is able to log in later though.  It had never happened before the new patch and his pc is working correctly.\r\n\r\nSo I want to ask: do you experience the same issues? Are we just so unlucky?\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}
