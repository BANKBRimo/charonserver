Subsequent activations (not the 3 auto attacks, but a full cd cycle of the ability) while not moving resulted in the sound effects to be played, but I would not get the bonus on-hit damage of Spirit Blade or the visual effects. \r\n\r\nGranted this is only realy an issue if you are for example farming the jungle and dont move around while clearing a camp but with {{champion:98}}  I do that sometimes when watching a fight to see if I need to ult while farming a jungle camp off-screen. It would be nice to know that in these situations I am not wasting my time trying to clear a camp with unempowered auto attacks alone.\r\n\r\nDid anyone else notice anything similar?","replies":[]}
