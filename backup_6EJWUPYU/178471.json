The fun factor overweighs.\r\nAlthough our core of 3-4 Players is still active, we don&#039;t really play regularly. So when some of us are up to play some Team Ranked, we do it spontaneously. But when we do, it&#039;s about to get freaking hot in EUW. ;)\r\nAYZY Gaming is more than a Team. It&#039;s a Lifestyle.\r\n\r\nSo what do we require from YOU in order to join us?\r\n\r\nELO: Gold+\r\nLanguage: German/English\r\nAge: 18+\r\nPrograms: Team Speak, WhatsApp\r\n\r\n... and of course AYZY mentality.\r\n\r\nSo if you think you fullfill these requirements, don&#039;t hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nK&uuml;hni\r\n\r\nPS: Yes we got placed in Bronze 3. It was not our fault cough. So yea.. It can only get better :D","replies":[]}
