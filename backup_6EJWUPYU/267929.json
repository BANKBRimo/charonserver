You cant use the q, r and the recall and the only way to fix this is to kill oneself. \r\nThis might sound not too bad but consider if you buy a Mejais and u have like 20 stacks its really bad to kill yourself just like in minute 40+ when 1 death can change the game its shit.\r\nPlus if your team flames you for suiciding since no one knows the bug and they dont understand this.\r\nIt would be really nice if someone would look into this because the bug excists a long time now.","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"Hades4000","date":"2015-05-01T14:21:44.612+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, but this is the german forum.
