I am currently Plat 2 and was Dia 5 last season.\r\nI mostly play Jhin and Lucian, can play other ADs too though.\r\nAlso from time to time I play with other friends, so there will be the occasional full goon squad games :D\r\nI use discord for voice communication (no download required) \r\n\r\nYou should be at least Plat and have a positive attitude if u wanna play with me :)\r\n\r\nSo if you are interested just add me --&gt; Raider Unleashed","replies":[]}
