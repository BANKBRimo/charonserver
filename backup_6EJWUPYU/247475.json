The damage gets through but the animation is missing. This makes kiting monsters and last hitting very difficult. It seems to be independent from the skins used since i used Commando J4 and i saw someone else mention the same bug on a different skin (Warring Kingdoms J4 : http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/de/c/bug-report/PUVwQLWx-gameplay-warring-kingdoms-jarvan-iv-autoattack-animation-bug).\r\n\r\nI went into a custom game and tried to replicate the bug but i haven&#039;t been able to. This is why I am not sure if the bug has sth to do with J4&#039;s passive, his E or his Q. Or maybe it has sth to do with ranked. When the bug happened to me it was in ranked and it started right away (red side - Gromp). \r\n\r\nGreetings MoC","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"MoCtheFirst","date":"2015-08-02T16:56:25.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can even hear the sound of the AA's but you can't see the animation. It happened on the first hit (passive maybe?), the 5th hit (Passive again?) but than also on the last hit that killed the monster (7th hit). Really not sure where the problem is coming from.","replies":[]},{"id":"","poster":"MacToast","date":"2015-08-02T16:35:31.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/c1TFOhqPSwM) of the game this happened, it is only a small exert, but the Auto Attack animation not happening is clearly visible. \nHere is also a link to the [replay](http://www.replay.gg/?r=EUW1&id=2230992410&key=fjfDjIaxJy9KXZf6fcYhZXgobYVfJV%2FR), as MoC already stated he wasn't able to reproduce this bug in a custom but it is visible in this game even as specator.","replies":[]}]}
