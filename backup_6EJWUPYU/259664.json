The additional turret( + the trinkets) are slowing the game down so much and\nyou want them take less dmg?","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"The Character","date":"2015-06-12T13:01:26.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had games vs siege comps (nida & azir duo lane w/o jungler). There is no way anyone can defend the turret alone, so your jungler has to sit under the turret as well from the beginning of the game. Because it takes 3 minutes for them to break the turret (same time for 1 full clear of the jungle).. Insanely fast","replies":[]}]}]}
