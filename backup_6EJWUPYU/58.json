This season I carried a lot of games as a Support, mainly playing my all-time best Lulu. I can play various champions as a Support. With this post I am offering my services to a Clash-team that looks for a Support to make their team full. I know that most probably my Lulu will be banned, but do not worry. I can play a lot of Supports. My strenghts are my team-oriented gameplay, i.e. keeping a high vision score and my wards up, always playing for the team (flashing for a heal or ult for my carries). My weaknesses could be that I rather outplay opponents by abusing their mistakes than to create plays to outplay them. And I do not like using Discord when playing League. To my opinion, I know very well what to do in what situation (dis-engage, roaming, objectives, warding) and talking and explaining my further moves rather keep me slow and distracted from the game as well as my teammates. Also there is no fixed playstyle to me. Though I like abusing enemies weaknesses, I do recognize when to take advantage and make plays aggressively. \r\n\r\nIf you have interest in completing your Clash-Team for next week Saturday, 14th March 2020, feel free to add me ingame. \r\n\r\n-Surryasha\r\n \"former rank 49 EUW Lulu\"","replies":[]}
