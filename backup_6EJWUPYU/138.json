Now i cant remember the accountname of the PBE account. When I open the PBE client and log in with the main account (which should be connected with the PBE account) Im on the normal Server (I dont know if this is normal). I never managed to log in to the PBE because i choose a dumb username i cant remember. Can I find my PBE log-in datas?
