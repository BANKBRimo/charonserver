Since the instant double q of rengar got patched you can&#039;t use your ferocity e sometimes even against minions and monsters which is really bad if you gank someone and you can&#039;t snare him. This doesn&#039;t occur every ferocity e but sometimes it does.\r\n2. I played another Rengar game today and something really weird happened: As I was ganking botlane with my ult my leap range got really really small when I wanted to get into the bush to reset the leap. I dont know why this happened (might aswell have been some bug with lulu or something); no it was not due to lulu silence, I just couldn&#039;t leap further than half of the leap range.\r\n\r\nPlease fix that Rito :)), Rengar got hard enough after you nerfed his e and q ratio don&#039;t destroy him completely with these bugs thx :))\r\n\r\nAlso i saw this happening on Wingsofdeath&#039;s stream with other champs like Aurelion Sol where he couldn&#039;t cast his ult when it was up.\r\n\r\nBtw I don&#039;t know how to get a screenshot into this post so forgive me, please. ^^","replies":[]}
