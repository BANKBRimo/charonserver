I havent had any problems until now with my connection and my roommate is already in the game playing, so it cant be my connection because we share the same cable line. \r\n\r\nI did another game before that and had no issues at all. Any ideas what might be the source of my problem? Whenever i try to reconnect my pings starts around 100 and drops to 60 - my regular ping is around 30. i did everything from rebooting my computer to restarting the client but the software just stucks me at 80% Load max. I closed all applications that might influence my conection but nothing helped. \r\n\r\nAny input how to solve this is welcome!","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"Living Tempest","date":"2015-07-02T13:50:02.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only Idea would be\n#Drophack","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"JGX","date":"2015-07-02T13:52:56.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way to protect me from Drophacks?","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"FÃºck Shaco","date":"2015-07-02T13:54:08.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope,\nsame problem here","replies":[]}]}]}]}
