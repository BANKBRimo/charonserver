That is why I want to make some montages for the community! If you want a montage you have to send me your SkinSpotlightReplay files, named with the time of the play/plays and the patch in which the game was played.\r\nSend all those things (also your summoner name and a song you would like (gotta see if it fits)) to flewsen.youtube@gmx.de. I&acute;ll upload the montage as not listed when it is ready, you&#039;ll get the link to download it.\r\nMentioning me in the desciption would make me happy ;)\r\n\r\nLink to my latest montage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDNB5ppYIKA","replies":[]}
