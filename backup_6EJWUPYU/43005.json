I think it might have to do with having 100% crit chance with HoB but I honestly have no idea so I hope a Riot member sees this and can explain/investigate/fix this.","url":"https://youtu.be/2zPnVdgSTBU?t=282","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2zPnVdgSTBU/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Der Bug im Video ist noch nicht behoben. Hail of Blades verhindert wohl irgendwie das der Letzte Autohit keinen erh&ouml;hten Schaden macht (execute).\r\nHabe es selbst getestet und auch einen Freund testen lassen.","replies":[]}
