We are a growing gaming community that sprouted from a very small game and we are trying to make a name for ourselves in this community. Our community manager behind this whole idea has been playing this game for a long time and knows that the best time to play is to play with friends. We have already been an avenue to create friendships over games in games such as Toribash and we want to expand that into League of Legends.\r\n\r\nWe have very promising plans to do with this community. We plan on hosting tournaments bi monthy on OCE,NA &amp; EUW and other servers once we get a good playerbase.","replies":[]}
