That&#039;s Rulebreaking and has to be fixed.\nIt is not possible to prevent Camille from dashing by Grounding her.\nNot her first instance and not even the second instance of her Dash (E).\n\nI already experienced it many many times in normals and rankeds.\nBoth scenarious should never happen.\n\nScenario 1:\n- Singed casts W;\n- W lays on the ground under Camille.\n- Camille casts her dash (E), dashes away and prevents her death.\n\nScenario 2:\n- Singed casts his W to where Singed will pull herself\n- Camille casts her dash (E) and pulls herself to a rock (terrain) where Singeds W lays on the ground\n- Camille is grounded\n- Camille dashes towards Singed (and kills him for example)\n\n\nFix it please. Dont ask for recorded material or proofs. You can simply recreate it. Just by doing it.\nDont say the first instance of Camilles E is a pull and not a dash.\nDont say the second instance of Camilles E is a &quot;push&quot; or dash and it is not possible that\nCamille dashes with second instance of her E and it must be a bug or it never happened.","replies":[]}
