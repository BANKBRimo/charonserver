Some people only wait for URF and dont even play any other modes anymore.\r\nSo for the love of god please give us Draft-URF back.\r\nIn its current state (as adressed in the video, all credits to MagikarpUsedFly) you just sit in the lobby wait untill you see your enemys for like half a secound and already know if you&acute;re gonna be buttfucked for 20 minutes or if its gonna be fun for you.\r\nBut the thing I hate the most is that I cant choose to play someone I think is fun in the mode. I have to pray to the LoL-Gods and bring forth the biggest sacrifices to maybe, JUST MAYBE get the slimmest chance of getting the Champion I wanna test out. For example I would want to play my mains in this gamemode just for fun and trying them out, BUT NO I cant because insert Kiandy&acute;s altered mentally challenged voice here All Random is so fun combined with this mode hahahahahaha - no ... no its not... just stop please. Give Draft URF back or at least make it AR for one time and the next time Draft.\r\nThank you for listening to me and have a nice day. :)","replies":[]}
