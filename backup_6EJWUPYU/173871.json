Just had a bad game in which we had a horrible teammate that refused to surrender, the enemy team wouldnt end, horrible experience. I was wondering if you could change it like, that after 3 failed (2/0) surrender votes or 5 failed 2/1 votes you can instantly surrender? Im not saying make it possible for 2 people to surrender straight away, but waiting for 3 up to 5 surrender votes is hopefully long enough. I know Twisted Treeline isnt that popular, but it feels like its the map with the most afks/ not surrendering &quot;trolls&quot; which would make a fix super nice. Thanks for reading, hope this will change anything. HF &amp; GL summoners out there! :)","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"SKT BANGarang","date":"2016-09-08T22:22:19.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Have to agree it is extremely irritating being trolled by people in that way, especially if they flame you and give up but they still vote no, or not at all in your case and they have all the power then. They choose whether to end your suffering or drag the game out as long as possible like the trolls they are. People who just want to ruin the fun for other people shouldn't have the power to do that and to be honest this is a big reason why i rarely play 3v3 anymore its just demoralising and unfun a change would be very welcome","replies":[]}]}
