If the headset is in surround-sound-mode I can hear all sounds of the client als intended (like clicking on play, the shop or champ select music). But if I turn this mode off all sounds seem to come from the right. I don&#039;t know what causes this issue with the lol client because everything else works fine in stereo as well as in surround sound mode.\r\nIf I only listen to the left phone i hear the sounds very silent so i assume its just a left-right sound-balancing issue but I can&#039;t find anything on the internet about it.\r\n\r\nAnyone experiencing the same or knowing how to fix it?\r\n\r\nThank you and best regards,\r\nschdeef","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"schdeef","date":"2015-08-12T20:01:43.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went to reddit just after posting that...
