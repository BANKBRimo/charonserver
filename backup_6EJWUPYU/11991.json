We are basically a small group of friends that have formed a team named HighPingClub. Our short-term goal is to hit masters on flex 5v5 as a team. We are currently 4 players and are looking for a toplaner to complete the team. Our jungle and mid are both D3 and our botlane is P3 in soloq but we're all gold in flex. If anyone is interested and has further questions or inquiries please do not hesitate to add me ingame and I will try to clarify the playing times and future plans. IGN: KaΤana.","replies":[]}
