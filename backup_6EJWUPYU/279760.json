League of Legends missing one thing .. an **Orc** .. LoL has elfs , gnomes and other creatures ..\" So I drew a Orc.\r\nLore : His name is **Dendar** he sailed  to Valaran from distant mystic lands to conquer new areas for his tribe. Legends say that Dendar has ability to hunt down anyone he wants and that no one can run from him, because he can smell blood  flowing through veins of Dendars prey {{item:2050}} . Dendar don't have one arm ,because long time ago he has lost it in a war and now instead of it he has an axe arm to crush skulls of his enemies who don't surrender to him. You can hear his war horn {{item:2051}} from a distance ..When you hear it ... start running {{summoner:6}} ... Dendar is coming and he'll never stop hunting you ! {{item:3409}}","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"Gelban der Reihe","date":"2015-02-24T16:01:23.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elfen?\nDass Yordle für dich Gnome sind, ok.\nAber Elfen?","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"VirtuousViolence","date":"2015-02-24T17:14:24.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gelban der Reihe,realm=EUW,application-id=L7E6lhzo,discussion-id=JkGbhtJO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-24T16:01:23.681+0000)\n>\n> Elfen?\n> Dass Yordle für dich Gnome sind, ok.\n> Aber Elfen?\n\nvllt.
