After they killed my old main Kalista, I became support main. Playing especially _Rakan; also  Janna, Nami, Lulu_. I&#039;m confident on this champs but adaptable if needed. I&#039;m a positive person, looking for an **ADC or Jungler**; in best case german. I&#039;m a good teamplayer and sure I&#039;m a good mate to climb with. Add me if u want; got discord or teamspeak. \n\nAlso searching vor mates to rebuild my** team**; need a **midlaner / toplaner / jungler**. I played some tournaments with my old team and would like to do this again and more often. I love it to play and tryhard as team; would be nice to find some guys for nice flex nights and serious tournament stuff. :) \n\nI&#039;m searching for mates to have fun with while improving and climbing; not for a booster or a date. :^)\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBWfuUKzJJU \nIf u are interested, check my Youtube for impressions. :) ","replies":[]}
