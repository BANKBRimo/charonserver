However, the client won`t open, unless I restart my computer. After restarting the pc the patch updates up until 30 percent. It remains at 30 percent roughly until eternity. When i close the client and try to restart it, the lol logo is just in the background and wont open. I tried every recommended tip on YouTube, but to no avail. Would need some tech support if possible, thanks!","replies":[]}
