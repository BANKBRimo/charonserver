We don&#039;t really think it&#039;s important which elo you are,\r\nbecause silver players can have a good attitude and a good playstyle just like plats or diamonds.\r\n\r\nSo if you&#039;re looking for a team which wants to play serious just add me.\r\n\r\nIGN: &#039;Lagamey&#039;, &#039;Madlife Inc&#039;, &#039;DuoQ Deathrocket&#039; and &#039;Dyrus is my hero&#039; (smurfs)\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a good time!","replies":[]}
