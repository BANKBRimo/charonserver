Since all my friends are either way worse then me (yes, that seems possible :D ) or (more likely) way better then me, I&#039;m now looking for players to play alongside to learn the game, since i still need to learn all the champs and their matchups. I watch leauge for over 3 years now and have a good amount of game knowledge, but cant really bring it into my play knowledge. I guess this needs time.\r\nWhatever: I&#039;m friendly, ready to learn and improve and look for other people to play and talk with while playing. Feel free to add me.\r\n\r\nCya in the rift, guys.","replies":[]}
