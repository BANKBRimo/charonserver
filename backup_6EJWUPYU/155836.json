But editing needs time! To get those clips i have to play an huge amount of games. Because of that i need some help to get more clips in lesser time to make more videos! So I&#039;d like to ask you to take a look at my channel and let me know if you like it. I would be glad if you can send me some of your plays and top moments.\r\n\r\nIf your are intrested in the editings or you want to send me your plays, just hit this [BUTTON](https://www.youtube.com/user/MyBaseTV/videos) and take a look on my videos. To send me the clips, just read the boxes under my videos.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! :D \r\n{{champion:48}}","replies":[]}
