The survey aims to better understand the motivations that drive people and the platforms they use to play and enjoy E-Sports today.\n\nThe survey includes 4 pages only, and it shouldn&rsquo;t take you any longer than 10 minutes to complete it. The survey is of course anonymous and cannot be linked to your person.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Survey**](http://goo.gl/forms/HHW4RWf4Vl)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_Thank you for your support! / Vielen Dank!_\n\n**Kiron J.
