It can take up to 48 hours for your account to get bumped up to max level and granted IP/RP, so please be patient. If you're having this issue, please:\n \n >- Play at least one full game (it can even be coop v. ai).\n> - Purchase an item from the store.\n >- Close your client and relog after these two steps.\n\n> If your account is still stuck at level 1 and 0 IP/RP after completing these steps, please wait 48 hours for the system to apply changes to your account. After this period if you are still stuck at level 1 0 IP/RP, please respond to this thread and I'll investigate to make sure that everything is working as intended.\n\n> Thanks Summoners ","replies":[]}]}
