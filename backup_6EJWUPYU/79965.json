Every week, you will have the possibility, if you want, to play against teams close to your level and earn rewards (RP if we have no problems with Riot). The different leagues will be based on the team&rsquo;s results of previous editions.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the tournament will be the Wednesday 9 an Thursday 10 between 20h and 00h Paris hour (At UTC 0 it would be 18h-22h, and in London it would be 19h-23h)\r\n\r\nThe format is the following :\r\n- 8 teams per league\r\n- Each team meets once\r\n- 4h hours of play on 2 following days\r\n- 4 games the first night\r\n- 3 games the second night (Plus 1h for potentials ties)\r\n\r\nFor the tie we know that can be the most frustrating part so we decided that in case of draw between 2 teams, instead of qualifying the team that won the direct matchup we will play a BO1 in the rift.\r\nIf 3 or 4 teams have the same number of point there will be a semifinal and a final in Howling abyss draft (To make game shorter and try to not use more than 1 hour to finish the tie).\r\nWe have other solutions for ties at 5 and more draw, and i can talk more about our tie system for 2-4 tie, but i will stop here, because it&rsquo;s not the most important stuff (Don&#039;t hesitate to ask questions)\r\n\r\nYou can already register on discord (Anguibok #864) or on the game (Anguibok).\r\nOur format is really precise and that why when you register you will be placed on a waiting list, waiting we have 8 teams more to create another league.\r\nWe recruit Free agents too.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m open for every question :3\r\n\r\nHoping to see you earning RP on our tournament &lt;3","replies":[]}
