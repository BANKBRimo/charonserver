He is actually kinda strong and I mean in a not very healthy way. Laning against a good Aatrox feels like an impossible matchup for you to win even with some ranged champs. The tradeoff is that he falls off severely in late, to end um like a Meatshield who gets outkided.\r\n\r\nI have an Idea to solve this solution: Let his q knockup duration scale with AD so it is weaker early and stronger later on. And I&#039;m not talking about these crazy 2sec knockup duration rather something softer like 0.8-1 secs might be enough already. Hope you can consider this a possibility ^^","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"DanionVibit","date":"2018-07-09T08:32:33.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox is in a good spot at this moment. He have a strong early (like Riven) but have a decent mid and hard lategame. Its a good trade-off that you can punish your enemies if they are too hyper aggressive in the early and you will fall off in the lategame (but high damage).\n\nIf you look at \"league of graphs\" he is in a great balance -> about 50% winrate\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Aatrox/\n\nBut yes, maybe they overtuned him for the first release (when you look at Diamond+ rankings) but its a normal process. I think they should nerf his lategame not his early in my opinion he is a earlygame bully like Darius.","replies":[]},{"id":"","poster":"SSI CptHaunted","date":"2018-07-09T07:47:27.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warum dann nicht einfach die Basewerte der Q verringern und dafür das Scaling erhöhen? Weniger Schaden im Early, mehr Schaden im Late.\n\n 1 Sekunde Knockup auf jeder Instanz bei nem Flächenskill ist schon ziemlich hart.","replies":[]}]}
