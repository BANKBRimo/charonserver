Even though Bengi probably didnt have the mechanically best plays of the tournament for me he still was the MVP of Worlds 2016. He was mainly the reason they won against ROX Tigers and against SSG, so I think he would've deserved the MVP title for this Worlds.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpkknTgwksw","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wpkknTgwksw/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me SKT T1 Bengi was easily the MVP of Worlds 2016 because he had so much impact in the games he played. In the semi-finals and finals he performed so good and kinda carried SKT to victory why he is the real MVP for me. So I made a little montage of Bengi&#039;s performance at worlds and I hope you guys will like it cause I did put a lot of effort into making it.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nuFreaky","replies":[]}
