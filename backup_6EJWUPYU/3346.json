Apparently while changing runes, clicking still registers with stuff in champ select (I'm unsure if I was making the request or if someone requested and while changing runes, I accepted, trying to configure runes). I was annoyed, but thought that it was just a one time, dumb bug.\r\nWhen I was in champ select the second time, it happened again, just that instead of switching champions, I somehow rerolled the champion I had when changing runes.\r\n(I didn't investigate any further, so there's no clear proof. I was just mad and quit the game to post my thoughts.) {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"FIÎ–Z","date":"2019-11-22T22:24:23.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to me regularly, i'm usually pretty pissed off when it happens","replies":[]}]}
