So I started the launcher again and he now scans just 2 files per second so patching takes a very long time. \r\nAlso my game crashes every time I leave champ select. I have to restart the whole client then to be able to reconnect. 2 mins after game started - gg.\r\nAlso just got LeaverBuster because you failed your job. This is just destroying any fun I had in the game.\r\nPLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR SHIT DONE FFS OR TURN DOWN THE SERVERS!","replies":[]}
