The highest rank I have reached in the SoloQ was Platin 1 in Season 4. After a break of over a year I decided to create a new account and focus on developing my skills at MID lane.\r\nEven though I have only played SoloQ, my motivation to make the jump to a five man premade is high. I just never took the steps to start playing in a competitive environment .\r\nMore personal information about me follows right now:\r\n\r\n    My name is Marvin and I am 22 years old\r\n    I enjoy an international environment\r\n    I am highly self reflective and I admit mistakes to learn and improve\r\n    I have an eye for details and working on them\r\n    I enjoy teaching and helping my teammates\r\n    I like to take responsibility and lead,at the same time there is no difficulty to follow others opinions and orders\r\n    I am eager for victory and have a high endurance to work for it\r\n    It is easy for me to get along with new people since I would describe myself as communicative, friendly and open person.\r\n    I see nothing positive in blaming or commanding others against their will, in my opinion the only way to truly get better you have to work together and help each other\r\n\r\nIf you feel like I could be a good addition to your team, feel free to contact me. I do not mind whether you are a team of people who know each other for a long time or just some online connection. I have quiet some time so we should be able to practice regularly.\r\n\r\nSo long,\r\nDCD","replies":[]}
