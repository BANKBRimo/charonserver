I look for players who main their role, who are good, who have some main champs and who are willing not to blame teammates, rather carry their own lane.\r\nConfident players with an aggression playstyle and skilled in fast paced games.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nLanguage: English\r\nCurrent Rank: Diamond 5+\r\nExperience: Main in a primary Role\r\n\r\nRoles needed:\r\nTOP: open\r\nJUNGLER: open\r\nMID: found\r\nADC: open\r\nSUPPORT: found\r\n\r\nRegards\r\naschmitoren","replies":[]}
