And I really want to reach Platinum V at the end of the season. (11.11.15)\r\nThe games were pretty easy to carry. Sometimes I had about 190cs at 20 mins and 250 at 27 mins.\r\nBut now its getting tough.\r\nSince I hit the Gold 3 tire I seem to stuck here which actually means that I belong in this league. \r\nI mostly play mid lane and adc since I can lasthit and backline well. Mapawareness also quite fine in my opinion.\r\nMy Champ pool for mid is Orianna, Ahri, Annie. Adc is Vayne, Tristana, Draven.\r\n\r\nWell I&acute;m playing on EUW name: Killerhost http://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/de/#match-history/EUW1/35334343?matchType=2.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could check my lolking or matchhistory. \r\n\r\nMy question is if anybody could help me to improve or give me some usefull tipps for climbing. \r\nIn the last times I played against some Diamond smurfs and I just saw the carrying the game solo with 22/0/6{{champion:107}}  or so.\r\nI want to beat people like that and to win games even though the enemys have a smurf.\r\nIts not much time and as I work, I cant play 24/7. But I really want to get Platinum.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your tipps/help.","replies":[]}
