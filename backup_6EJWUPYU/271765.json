I&#039;m a Diamond player nowadays and have lots of tactical experience in this game. For my part i prefer the positions ADC, SUP or JUNGLE. With ADC and/or SUP i wasted most of my time. To be honest I love Supporting!\n\nI&#039;m looking for a high performance Team to improve in Team play and to collect some new experience. For me age is a matter of fact or at least mature appearience. I&#039;m willing to take this serious and so I&#039;m not looking for some fun gaming, childish give ups and throws. Throws are of course not avoidable and I'm not perfect myself, but I&#039;m sure to understand the difference between quality gaming and goofing around. I&#039;m open in any fact of tactical tryouts.\n\nRespect and kindness is in my opinion very important for a nice Team-up so lets keep it calm do our best. If this writing inspired you of me joining your Team i would feel honored to go for some try out games.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJohnny / Mr Barton","replies":[]}
