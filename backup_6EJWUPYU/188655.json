It happens too often, that people get into a ranked-lobby and get a teammate that picks a stupid champion for his role or just straight up says that hes trolling. Therefore as mentioned already I would find it a great inclusion into the game to be able to report people early on in the lobby and maybe even cancel the matchmaking process if enough reports are sent in during the draft.\r\nPlease let me know, what you all think!\r\nYours,\r\nNiclas","replies":[]}
