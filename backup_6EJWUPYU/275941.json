The Purple Team only plays Urf the manatee as champ and they need to defend their big urf.\r\n\r\nRewards: 5 wins = icon with a urf on it. |   10 wins = icon with a urf wearing a crown\r\n \r\ntime: 20 - 30 mins\r\n\r\nPurple Team (Urf team): They need to defend the big Urf that replaces the Nexus for 30 minutes. If the purple team succeeds to defend Urf for 30 (or 20) minutes, they win. If not, they loose. Purple team has full map vision on their side (no fog of war on their side)\r\n\r\nBlue Team (Warwick team): They need to destroy the enemy big Urf within 30 (or 20) minutes. If they succeed, they win. If not, they loose. Blue team has +15% bonus movement speed.\r\n\r\nUrfs base: The Inhibitors are replaced with attracking Urfs, the Nexus is replaced with one big attacking Urf the manatee.\r\n\r\nWarwicks base: The Inhibitors are replaced with movement speed boosters, the fountain tower has a range that reaches the end of their base, so the Urfs can't try to destroy the enemy nexus and spawn camp.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and think about it. :)","replies":[]}
