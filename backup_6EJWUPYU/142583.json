I mostly play normal games and im trying to have a good time with my buddys and i dont know  what the reason  for it but we get matched with an enemy team that has like 300 MMR more than ours and first i didnt really mind and thought:&quot; yeah, ok i guess its nice to learn something about the game and we can improve from it.&quot; But its not just the enemy team sometimes we get a team with 300 MMR more but that is like the case in 1 out of 4 games. After a while its getting a little annoying since me and my friends want to kind of shut down our tryhardmode if you can call it that and we join normal games. I feel like that it is harder to win a normal game than a ranked game. The Ranked games Matchmaking is fine and all but that doesnt mean it has to be bad in a normal game. I dont know if it has happend to other people like it happends to me and my friends. (I am silver)\nBut i am almost happy with everythingelse in the game ^^","replies":[]}
