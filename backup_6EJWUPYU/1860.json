Maybe some of you will remember the announcement of Riot three years ago. They wanted to release a new Skin for Quinn, a Project: Quinn Skin. It never came. I really think it would be a good Idea to release a new Skin for her. The Skin would make her a bit more popular and maybe new Players or the ones that never played Quinn before try out playing her in Summoners Rift. Over time Quinn wasn't played really often. Many People would profit from the new Skin. The Quinn-players who'll get a new Skin (which they will be very happy Abou) and the players who take notice of Quinn and give this Champion a try. \r\nThat's all for now, \r\nhave a nice day!","replies":[]}
