I&#039;m a 20 year old guy from germany.\nUsually I tend to create big threads in this board, but this time I want to keep it short.\nAs the title says, I am a Dia 5 player who wants to grind for Master Tier this season as a final goal. I have been maining adc for 5 years now, but I have switched to support a few weeks ago and made it up to dia 4 like that. Sadly I&#039;ve been tilting or whatever, so I lost some elo again.\nThis means I am flexible on botlane.\nI want you to have the same goal as I have. Improve, gain, have fun. \nYou need to be mature and synergizing with me along with speaking decent english and a fair bit of free time you want to spend with me.\nIf you are interested, please leave a post here preferably or add me ingame (rather not.. just do the forum post).\nGood game, well played.\nMaserMynd","replies":[]}
