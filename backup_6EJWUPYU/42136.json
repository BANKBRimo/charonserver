My name is Nubels and I am a 18-year-old high diamond adc player from germany. My English is very fluid and I don&#039;t mind if the language of the team is English or German. I have been on the amateur teams Hybrid eSports before but that was quite a while ago and I struggle to improve playing only solo queue. Playing on a team would motivate to become better at the game.\r\nMy peak ranks are Master in EUW and Challenger on the Russian server, currently I am Diamond 2 EUW.\r\nPlease contact me!\r\nMy twitter\r\nhttps://twitter.com/nubelss\r\nMy op.ggs\r\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=FSL+Nubels (FSL is not a team, it is a tag my friends and me use)\r\nhttp://ru.op.gg/summoner/userName=Nubels","replies":[]}
