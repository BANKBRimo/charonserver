Looking for a friendly ADC Main to rush through Gold to Platin.\nGot 61% winrate on Zyra, 59% on Lulu, raised from S3 to G3 promos in around 45 games, so I prefer to keep up the pace (got around 1000 games in normals). If both my supports are picked/banned, I prefer Galio & Bard to roam to mid after pushing in waves and swing the game that way. Lastly, Janna & Soraka would be my choice, I guess, to guarantee a winning lane.\n\nJust message me ingame: Aielun\n\nBest wishes!","replies":[]}
