I started a request for reseting my password which worked so I changed it. This was strange because I tried to change it into the one thought I used before but I was told that I can&#039;t change my password into the same which exist at the moment. So I chose an other one so far so good. Now it isn&#039;t possible for me to login into the client with any of these passwords but it is possible to login on the official website.\r\nCan someone give me some suggestions what i could do. I already tried some more password changes when I was logged in on the website.","replies":[]}
