It seems to decay down further until the regular movement speed of the champion is reached. On the next tick it is resetting to value it should be (it applies Masteries Items etc).\r\nI noticed that just for the Mastery Movement Speed gain, I cannot say anything about the other Abilities that give movement speed.","replies":[]}
