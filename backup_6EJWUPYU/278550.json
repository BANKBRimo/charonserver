And as far as i know , the skin was given to all polish players. I'm Bulgarian and i suggest one skin for GRAVES . Skin Name : Guardian or Guard Graves .So here are a couple of pictures from Bulgarian Guards : 1st - http://i.imgur.com/Y29yGoU.jpg 2nd-  http://i.imgur.com/SD8eqWI.jpg . I think this skin will be looking good on Graves. The Animations : CTRL + 2 says : I serve to the Republic. CTRL + 1 : Will be marching on place.\r\n\r\nSo thats it from me , i hope you like it :)\r\nBest Wishes :)","replies":[]}
