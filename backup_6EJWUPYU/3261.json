(macOS 2019)","subforum":"Hilfe & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We, I and my brother, had this issue now for years, every now and then after a patch we are getting this \"trying to reconnect\" error, until it disappears for few versions, just to come back in half a year or so. Every time we search everywhere online and try every work around/fix, with out luck.\r\nThe only solution to this problem is to wait until the message disappears, and everything works fine. Sometimes this is done in 1-2 minutes but sometimes we sit around for half an hour without luck.\r\nPlease fix this issue, as it makes the game very frustrating to play/start and often leads to just don't play because it is hard to justify 30 mins of waiting for 40 min of gameplay.\r\n\r\nif anyone has a recent fix of that please let me know.\r\nwe have a 2018 and 2014 MacBook Pro and the most recent software updates, but it appeared independently form the OS version.","replies":[{"id":"","poster":"La Mur√®ne","date":"2020-03-07T09:26:24.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is an easy fix : \nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/d0mmq6kT-fix-for-the-trying-to-reconnect-bug-on-mac","replies":[]},{"id":"","poster":"ObezahrarStrizzi","date":"2019-11-18T08:20:58.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.
