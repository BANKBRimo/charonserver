I'm playing a 5v5 with my fixed team, we're all in the \"searching for a game\" screen, then suddenly they are all in the game, and for me it still says that I'm searching for a game. So while they're picking champions, I'm still searching for a game. So I exit LoL, and every time, the moment that it exits, I hear the gong sound which means I can enter a game, but I can't because obviously I've just quit, and then the game my team are in end because it says I've quit, plus after various attempts to get into lobby I get the time penalty for leaving of up to 15 minutes.\n\n2.) I actually get into champion select, and we're in the banning phase. Then suddenly it looks to me like the enemies have missed a ban, but everyone else can see the ban. And it's just stuck there, I can't see what other people have picked, and it just stays in the banning phase forever. So I end up getting a random champion because I can't see what's going on.\n\nOn the occasions where I do get into a game, I have absolutely no problems with lag, and my latency is absolutely fine. So what on earth is going on, and could anybody please tell me how to fix it?","replies":[]}]}
