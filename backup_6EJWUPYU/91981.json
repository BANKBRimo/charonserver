I dont knwo if it is caused by the skin or if it is on ekko no matter what, but it seems his running animation when having the homeguard effect or when his movementspeed excells throught other buffs is a little bit bugged.\r\nIts not a major bug it is more or less only visual.\r\nIt happens when you exit the really-hight-Movementspeed-Animation, when you usally have the normal walk the champion does on low Movementspeed.\r\nThe animation remains and you basicly see him running while only at a basic Movementspeed level. This bug disappears as soon as you stop your champion model with the S key but as long as you dont stop moving the animation remains.\r\nSorry for not providing footage but since it happened that way 10/10 times i would appreciate if you could adjust this little eyecandy so i dont have to look at my champ doing giant steps while moving at .5 mph ! :D\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and have a nice day\r\n\r\nSome name but defenitly not mine","replies":[]}
