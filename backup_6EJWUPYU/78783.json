In my opinion she should be updated, and my Idea would be to make her W passive deal a little less instant damage, but everytime she procs it on a champion, she gets some onhit magic damage against that champ, for the next 5 seconds. That damage could also be %-max HP, and also it can scale with AP. That lets Kalista use the AP from rageblade (which she builds anyways) and maybe even enables her to get sth. like a nashors tooth. Make her embrace the onhit style.","replies":[]}
